## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves **loading**, **exploring**, and **visualizing** the **World Population Dataset** to analyze the distribution of both **categorical** and **continuous** variables.  
The goal is to provide visual insights into how the global population is distributed across **continents**, **countries**, and over **time**.

---

## 📦 Dataset Used

**Source:** `world_population.csv`  
Contains demographic data including:
- Country/Territory
- Capital
- Continent
- Population by year (2010, 2015, 2020, 2022)
- Population density
- Growth rates
- Global population share

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data handling
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualization

## 📊 Key Visualizations

1. **Distribution of Population by Continent**
   - Bar plots to show how population is spread among continents.

2. **Histogram of Population Sizes**
   - Understands frequency of population ranges (e.g., <10M, 10M–100M, etc.)

3. **Boxplots**
   - Highlights population distribution and outliers by continent.

4. **Pie Charts**
   - Visualize share of global population by country or continent.

5. **Line Plots / Trends**
   - Population growth trends over years (2010–2022) for selected countries.

---

## 🔍 Insights Gained

- Asia holds the largest share of global population.
- Countries like India and China significantly skew population-related metrics.
- Some continents like Oceania and South America show unique growth patterns.
- Large disparities in population densities across continents.
